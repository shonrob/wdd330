            <h4>Think, Design, Test, Create</h4>
            <p>I appreciate how "Doing more with web stuff" starts with the steps to </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think</li>
                    <li>Design</li>
                    <li>Test</li>
                    <li>Create</li>
                </ul>
            <p>because it helps break down the code. I often have the tendency to see the entire project and get overwhelmed.  However, with these steps I can break the project into parts and think through each portion. I know I will have many redo projects and repeating the steps, but I look forward to piecing the page together.

                I love the simplicity of the book as it walks through all the information for anyone.  It would have been a great resource when I started my journed to learning about coding.  I started knowing nothing and with each course I take I have the opportunity to learn more even though I don't master it.
